How to build
------------

- Install Ant 1.6.5
- put a JBoss AS binary distribution in the "jboss" folder (the version number must match what is in build.properties.default)
- Alternatively type "ant download" to download the JBoss AS binary matching the build.properties.default defined version
- type "ant"; the result is in "output/jbossweb-versionnumber"
