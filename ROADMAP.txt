Roadmap for JBoss Web 3.0

- Implement Servlet 3.0 async for APR HTTP connector
- Update digester XML parsing rules for web.xml updates
- Implement new APIs for programmatic deployment descriptor access
- Setup standalone TCK environment for testing compliance with the new features
- Implement annotation scanning for JBoss Web standalone (likely disabled by default using conf/web.xml)
- Implement any other Servlet 3.0 changes (web.xml fragments, security, etc)
- Implement JSP 2.2 changes
- Implement Servlet 3.0 async for APR AJP connector
- Implement Servlet 3.0 async for java.io HTTP connector
- Implement Servlet 3.0 async for java.io AJP connector
- Coordinate with AS 6 to implement new web.xml parsing (out of tree)
- Coordinate with AS 6 for annotation updates (out of tree)
- Diagnostic and monitoring features

Other possible features:
- .net support like the php support (looks ok, but PHP is hard to use, how would this be different ?)
- fastcgi servlet (sounds useless)
- Java proxy (probably too many components needed to compete with mod_cluster, but a very basic HTTP proxy could be useful
  for the rewrite valve)
