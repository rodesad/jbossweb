Roadmap for JBoss Web 3.0

Main development:
- Setup standalone TCK environment for testing compliance with the new features
- Servlet 3.0 async API over IO events
- Update digester XML parsing rules for web.xml updates
- Annotation scanning for JBoss Web standalone (likely disabled by default using conf/web.xml)
- Multipart support (and remove fileupload)
- Other Servlet 3.0 changes (web.xml fragments, security, etc)
- JSP 2.2 changes
- EL 1.1 changes
- Coordinate with AS 6 to implement new web.xml parsing (out of tree)
- JBoss Metadata parsing of .tld files (out of tree)
- Coordinate with AS 6 for annotation updates (out of tree)

Other:
- Diagnostic and monitoring features (provided by the jopr/JON agent, as JBoss Web standalone seems too
  lightweight for embeddede jopr/JON to make sense)
- .net support like the php support (looks ok, but PHP is hard to use, how would this be different ?)
- fastcgi servlet (sounds useless)
- Java proxy (probably too many components needed to compete with mod_cluster, but a very basic HTTP proxy could be useful
  for the rewrite valve)
