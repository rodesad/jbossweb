Roadmap for JBoss Web 3.0

Standalone:
- Resources overlay implementation
- Jasper plugin for TLD metadata
- Access control annotations
- Update digester XML parsing rules for web.xml updates (session tracking-mode, cookie-config, servlet enabled,
  servlets and filters async-supported, http-method-omission)
- Enforce web.xml fragments merging rules
- Lazy webapp startup valve
- Abstract JMX in custom modeler better
- JSP 2.2 changes
- EL 1.1 changes

JBoss AS:
- JBoss Metadata parsing of .tld files (out of tree)
- Coordinate with AS 6 to implement new web.xml parsing (out of tree)
- Coordinate with AS 6 for annotation updates (out of tree)

Other:
- Setup standalone TCK environment for testing compliance with the new features
- Diagnostic and monitoring features (provided by the jopr/JON agent, as JBoss Web standalone seems too
  lightweight for embedded jopr/JON to make sense)
- .net support like the php support (looks ok, but PHP is hard to use, how would this be different ?)
- fastcgi servlet (sounds useless)
- Java proxy (probably too many components needed to compete with mod_cluster, but a very basic HTTP proxy could be useful
  for the rewrite valve)
