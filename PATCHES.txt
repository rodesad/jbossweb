711711 711714 711716 711720
Useless session access time refactoring

719602
Dynamic change for maxThreads in the bare bones thread pool, which go against its simplicity goal
(an executor should be used instead)

720728
Multiple pollers, which adds the complexity of needing a map to track to which poller a connection belongs 
(needed in IO event mode). There are 3 pollers already, which should be able to handle a lot of traffic. 

various
All changesets introducing generics, which have small value (new code or refactorings should use generics,
however)
