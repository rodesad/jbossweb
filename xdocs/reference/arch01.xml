 <p>Tomcat Native uses <a href="http://apr.apache.org">APR</a> and
  <a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> to 
  provide superior scalability, performance, and better integration with native server 
  technologies. The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at 
  the heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to advanced IO
  functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and TCP corking),
  OS level functionality (random number generation, system status, etc),
  and native process handling (shared memory, NT pipes and Unix domain sockets).
