      <br/>
      <p>JBoss Web comes with Windows service executable that can run JBoss Web Server
      as service.
      </p>
      <p>The service executable <code>jbosssvc.exe</code> transforms the <code>run.bat</code>
      and <code>shutdown.bat</code> batch scripts to services. This means that any change
      made to those scripts will be used both in service and command line mode.
      </p>

    <section name="Customization">
      <br/>
      <p>Service customization is done by editing the service.bat script.
      Each command has a separate section that you can customize. The most
      common customization task would be changing service names if more then
      one service instances per box are required.
