<section name="What is AJP Protocol?">
<p>
The <b>AJP13</b> protocol is packet-oriented.  A binary format was
presumably chosen over the more readable plain text for reasons of
performance.  The web server communicates with the servlet container over
TCP connections.  To cut down on the expensive process of socket creation,
the web server will attempt to maintain persistent TCP connections to the
servlet container, and to reuse a connection for multiple request/response
cycles.
</p><p>
Once a connection is assigned to a particular request, it will not be
used for any others until the request-handling cycle has terminated.  In
other words, requests are not multiplexed over connections.  This makes
for much simpler code at either end of the connection, although it does
cause more connections to be open at once.
</p><p>
Once the web server has opened a connection to the servlet container,
the connection can be in one of the following states:
</p><p>
<ul>
  <li> Idle <br/> No request is being handled over this connection. </li>
  <li> Assigned <br/> The connecton is handling a specific request.</li>
</ul>
</p>
