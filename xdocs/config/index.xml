 <p>JBoss Web uses Embedded Tomcat. The Configuration model is the same as for the JBoss
 Application Server. This gives you an easy transition from JBoss Web Server to full-blown
 Application Server.

<section name="APR in JBoss Web">

<p>
    JBoss Web uses the <a href="http://apr.apache.org/">Apache Portable Runtime</a> to
    provide superior scalability, performance, and better integration with native server
    technologies. The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at
    the heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to advanced IO
    functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level functionality (random number
    generation, system status, etc), and native process handling (shared memory, NT
    pipes and Unix sockets).
</p>

<p>
    These features allows making JBoss Web a general purpose webserver, will enable much better
    integration with other native web technologies, and overall make Java much more viable as
    a full fledged webserver platform rather than simply a backend focused technology.
